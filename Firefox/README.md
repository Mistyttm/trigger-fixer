# Trigger fixer

Yeah, I'm doing this now. This is a chrome extension that allows you to:
* input words that may cause you upset, and choose what to replace them with
* delete these words from your list
* it can therefore be used to remove your deadname, should you be so inclined

Pretty cool, right?

I, Emmey, have ported the whole thing to firefox as well as contributed stuff behind the scenes and redesigned all the CSS :)
